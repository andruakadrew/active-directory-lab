# Security Groups
Security groups are responsible for managing access permissions to network resources efficiently and accurately by grouping users, computers, and other groups together. In my homelab, I created security groups for each organizational unit and 
assigned my GPOs to those security groups. I also ensured that every user within each OU was assigned to that security group.
