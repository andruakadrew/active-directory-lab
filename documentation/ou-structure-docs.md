# Organizational Units
![OU Structure](https://github.com/andruakadrew/active-directory-lab/blob/main/screenshots/ou_structure.png)

## Overview
Organizational units provides a way to strucutre and manage groups of users, computers, or other objects within a large system such as a Network. In my homelab I configured 5 different Organization Units.
- Computers (manages physical devices present in my network)
- Inventory (responsible for handling all merchandise stored in the inventory system)
- IT (administraotrs that handle all technical related issues)
- Management (oversee operations, managing recourses and personnel)
- Sales (responsible for the sale and distribution of goods and services, handling customer interactions and managing sale transactions)

## Users and Groups
Inside Organizational Units, different objects can be found representing Users accounts, Groups, devices, and other Organizational Units. 
For Simplicity purposes, I decided to only add 3 users per OU and One Security Group per OU (I will talk about Security Groups later on...)
